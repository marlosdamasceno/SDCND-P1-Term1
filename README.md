# Finding Lane Lines on the Road
Here is the first project of Term1 by Marlos Damasceno.
I kept all the structure as the same as I downloaded from git. Therefore you should execute the code on the Jupyter file *P1.ipynb*, following the order pf the comments `# ---------- 1`, because it is odd the order of the code with the documentation together.
Moreover, the Writeup file is where I do the relevant information.
